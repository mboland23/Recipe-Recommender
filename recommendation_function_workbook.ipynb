Here's what I did different:  I peeled my potatoes and diced them very small. I left out the creamed corn, nutmeg, cayenne pepper, and parsley.  Instead I used approx. 1 tsp of Old Bay seasoning. Then right before I stirred in the crab meat, I used my potato masher to mash up some of the potatoes.  This makes the chowder a little thicker.  These are all just my personal preferences.  I have made this several times and have forgotten to review it.  It's awesome!  Thanks Pantry Chef Starkey.</td>\n",

I made as is, except that I added about 1/4lb bacon, which I diced and fryed, tossed with 8oz crab the recipe called for and added about 1 cup pre cooked shirmp. Fryed them all together for a moment and put that all into the chowder. I also used a small can of creamed corn, as I'm not a huge fan of it. I think it needs salt for sure, I also increase the nutmeg and cayenne and added a bit of a chilli/garlic sauce. Good soup, I'll use it again.</td>\n",

       "11  Wow!  My family loves this recipe and it is a great winter meal.  I do have to say that I adjusted a little but the base remains the same.  Here's what I did different:  I peeled my potatoes and diced them very small. I left out the creamed corn, nutmeg, cayenne pepper, and parsley.  Instead I used approx. 1 tsp of Old Bay seasoning. Then right before I stirred in the crab meat, I used my potato masher to mash up some of the potatoes.  This makes the chowder a little thicker.  These are all just my personal preferences.  I have made this several times and have forgotten to review it.  It's awesome!  Thanks Pantry Chef Starkey.  \n",

This was the perfect warm-up at the end of a cold, snowy day.  I used more crab meat than the recipe called for, but otherwise followed the directions.  This was so simple, and worked well to put in the crockpot to keep warm while I waited for Hubby to come home for the evening.  We will make this again.  \n",

I doubled the crab, and added some carrots (and some extra broth to compensate.)  We still thought there should be more crab though.  The nutmeg flavor was wonderful and the cayenne added a tiny kick.  Lovely recipe PCS!  \n",

I made as is, except that I added about 1/4lb bacon, which I diced and fryed, tossed with 8oz crab the recipe called for and added about 1 cup pre cooked shirmp. Fryed them all together for a moment and put that all into the chowder. I also used a small can of creamed corn, as I'm not a huge fan of it. I think it needs salt for sure, I also increase the nutmeg and cayenne and added a bit of a chilli/garlic sauce. Good soup, I'll use it again.  "
